# Machine_learning_with_C
Codes the machine learning in C

1. Simple perceptron with C -> Binary classification. The dimensions can be changed in the cols variable, which only accepts two classes 
2. Added Linear regression for two variables, only for one coefficient.
3. K-means clustering. The objective was to segment heart data. However, the data is restricted so, the algorithm was designed to cluster two random classes.
4. KNN model used to classify diabetes. Due to the unavailable data, the method classifies two random classes.
5. Naive Bayes. Classification algorithm used for binary classification.
