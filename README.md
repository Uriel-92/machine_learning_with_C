# Machine_learning_with_C
Codes the machine learning in C

1. Simple perceptron with C -> Binary classification. The dimensions can be changed in the cols variable only accepts two classes 
2. Added Linear regression for two variables, only for one coefficient.
3. K-means clustering. The objective was to segment heart data. However, the data is unavailable, so the algorithm was designed to cluster two random classes.
