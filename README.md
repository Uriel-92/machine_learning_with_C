# Machine_learning_with_C
Codes the machine learning in C

1. Simple perceptron with C -> Binary classification. The dimensions can be changed in the cols variable only accepts two classes 
2. Added Linear regression for two variables, only for one coefficient.
3. K-means clustering. The objective was to segment heart data. However, the data is restricted so, the algorithm was designed to cluster two random classes.
4. KNN model used to classify diabetes. Due to the data being unavailable, the method just classifies two random classes.
